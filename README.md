## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts:

### Backend
- Built with Node.js and Express.
- Handles API requests, authentication, and database operations.
- Key directories:
  - `controllers/`: Contains logic for handling API requests.
  - `models/`: Defines database schemas using Mongoose.
  - `routes/`: Defines API endpoints.
  - `middleware/`: Contains authentication and role-based access control logic.

### Frontend
- Built with React.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for teachers and students.
- Key directories:
  - `pages/`: Contains page components for different routes.
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components.
  - `assets/styles/`: Global and theme-specific styles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment and simplified management)
- Make (for using the Makefile commands)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/samiel9/OnlineExamPlatform.git
    cd OnlineExamPlatform
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Use the Makefile to install dependencies for both backend and frontend.
    ```bash
    make install-deps
    ```
    This command will run `npm install` in both the `backend` and `frontend` directories.

3.  **Environment Variables**:
    The backend requires a `JWT_SECRET` for token generation. A `.env` file is needed in the `OnlineExamPlatform` root directory (it will be used by `docker-compose.yml`).
    Create a `.env` file in the project root:
    ```
    OnlineExamPlatform/.env
    ```
    Add your secret:
    ```env
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_strong_and_unique_jwt_secret
    ```
    Replace `your_super_strong_and_unique_jwt_secret` with a strong, unique secret. You can generate one using `openssl rand -hex 32`.

## Development

You can run the frontend and backend services locally for development without Docker, or use Docker for a production-like environment.

### Local Development (without Docker)

-   **Start Backend Server**:
    ```bash
    make dev-backend
    ```
    This will start the backend server (usually on `http://localhost:5000`).

-   **Start Frontend Development Server**:
    ```bash
    make dev-frontend
    ```
    This will start the frontend development server (usually on `http://localhost:3000`).

### Dockerized Development & Production

The `Makefile` provides convenient targets for managing the application with Docker Compose.

-   **Build and Start Services (Default)**:
    ```bash
    make all
    ```
    Or simply:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    This command builds the Docker images (if they don't exist or have changed) and starts all services (`mongo`, `backend`, `frontend`) in detached mode. The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend at `http://localhost:5000`.

-   **Build Services Only**:
    If you only want to build or rebuild the Docker images without starting them:
    ```bash
    make build-services
    ```

-   **Start Services (assumes images are built)**:
    ```bash
    make start
    ```

-   **Stop Services**:
    ```bash
    make stop
    ```

-   **Restart Services**:
    ```bash
    make restart
    ```

-   **View Logs**:
    To view logs from all running services:
    ```bash
    make logs
    ```
    To follow logs: `docker compose logs -f`

-   **Check Service Status**:
    ```bash
    make ps
    ```

## Testing

-   **Run All Tests**:
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
    This runs both backend and frontend tests.

-   **Run Backend Tests**:
    ```bash
    make test-backend
    ```

-   **Run Frontend Tests**:
    ```bash
    make test-frontend
    ```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment
The primary method for deployment is using Docker.
1.  Ensure your `.env` file is configured with a production `JWT_SECRET`.
2.  Build and start the services:
    ```bash
    make all
    ```
    This will build fresh images and start the containers. The application will be available on the ports defined in `docker-compose.yml` (frontend: 3000, backend: 5000, mongo: 27017 by default).

### Frontend Deployment to GitHub Pages
The frontend can be deployed as a static site to GitHub Pages. This setup assumes the backend is running and accessible (e.g., your local Dockerized backend or a publicly hosted backend).

1.  **Configure `package.json`**:
    Ensure the `homepage` field in `frontend/package.json` is correctly set for your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`). This has been pre-configured for `https://samiel9.github.io/OnlineExamPlatform/`.

2.  **Deploy**:
    ```bash
    make deploy-frontend
    ```
    This command will build the frontend and deploy it to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.

    **Note**: When using the GitHub Pages frontend, it will attempt to connect to the backend API at `http://localhost:5000/api` by default (as configured in `frontend/src/services/api.js`). Ensure your local backend (e.g., via `make start`) is running and accessible if you are testing the GitHub Pages deployment against it.

## Makefile Targets Summary

-   `make dev-backend`: Starts the backend development server locally (no Docker).
-   `make dev-frontend`: Starts the frontend development server locally (no Docker).
-   `make test`: Runs all backend and frontend tests.
-   `make test-backend`: Runs backend tests.
-   `make test-frontend`: Runs frontend tests (CI mode).
-   `make build-services`: Builds all Docker images using `docker compose build`.
-   `make start`: Starts all services using `docker compose up -d --build`.
-   `make stop`: Stops all services using `docker compose down`.
-   `make restart`: Restarts all services using `docker compose restart`.
-   `make logs`: Shows logs from running services.
-   `make ps`: Shows the status of running services.
-   `make deploy-frontend`: Builds and deploys the frontend to GitHub Pages.
-   `make clean`: Removes `node_modules`, frontend `build` directory, and stops Docker containers.
-   `make clean-docker`: Stops Docker containers and removes images built by compose.
-   `make clean-build`: Removes the `frontend/build` directory.
-   `make clean-node-modules`: Removes `node_modules` from both backend and frontend.
